# To-do-List
Run the app:

Menu options:

1 — Add task: type task text and press Enter (saved to tasks.txt).

2 — Remove task: enter the task number shown by View, or 'c' to cancel.

3 — View tasks: shows numbered list from tasks.txt.

4 — Clear all tasks: confirm with 'y' to delete every task.

q — Quit the app.

Notes:
Tasks are stored in tasks.txt in the same folder (one task per line).

Press Ctrl+C to exit — the app handles KeyboardInterrupt and exits cleanly.
